##Kangaroo Messenger Client

###What is this?

It's educational project I've accomplished in terms of my university
'Networks and data bases' semestrial course.

###How to run it?

To build and execute this run
```
mvn clean compile assembly:single
java -jar ./target/kangaroo-messenger-client-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
*JRE 8(with JavaFX 8) required.*

To be able to do something more than nothing, you need to run the 
[server](https://github.com/lfyuomr-gylo/KangarooMessengerServer).
After that you can log in or register, find another user and start
chatting.

###How it looks?
This little [demo](https://yadi.sk/d/aVbJS8xasireV) shows in action 
basic functionality of Kangaroo Messenger.
